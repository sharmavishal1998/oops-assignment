        "#2- Object-An object is a real thing made using the class blueprint. So, if \"Car\" is the class, a specific car (like your red Honda) is an object of that class.\n",
        "#3- Encapsulation- This is about wrapping the details of an object and hiding some parts from the outside world. It’s like having a TV remote: you can press buttons (methods), but you don’t need to know how the electronics inside work.\n",
        "#4- Inheritance- Inheritance is when one class gets features from another. If you have a class called \"Animal\" with legs and sound, a \"Dog\" class can inherit from it and automatically have legs and sound, without needing to redefine them.\n",
        "#5- Polymorphism- This means that different objects can use the same action in different ways. For example, both a \"Dog\" and a \"Cat\" can have a \"speak\" method, but a dog might bark, and a cat might meow.\n"
